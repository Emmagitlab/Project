      This include file is used by both the OS502 and
      the Z502 Simulator.

      Revision History:
        1.0 August 1990:        first release
        1.1 Jan    1991:        Additional disks added
        1.3 July   1992:        Make as many defines as possible
                                into shorts since PCs are happier.
        1.6 June   1995:        Minor changes
        2.0 Jan    2000:        A large number of small changes.
        2.1 May    2001:        Redefine disk layout
        2.2 July   2002:        Make code appropriate for undergrads.
        3.0 August 2004:        Modified to support memory mapped IO
        3.1 August 2004:        Implement Memory Mapped IO
        3.11 August 2004:       Implement OS level locking capability
        3.13 Nov.   2004        Change priorities of LINUX threads
        3.40 August 2008        Fix code for 64 bit addresses
        3.41 Sept.  2008        Change Z502_ARG to support 64 bit addr.
        3.50 August 2009        Minor cosmetics
        3.60 August 2012        Updates with student generated code to
                                support MACs
        4.00 August 2013        Major revision of how tests run.  There are
                                now many threads, one for each process.  All
                                macros in the tests have disappeared.
        4.01 October 2013       Small fix in test1j.
        4.20 May 2015:          Serious changes to MemoryMappedIO.  Made atomic
        .                       StatePrinter made atomic
        4.30 Jan 2016           StudentConfiguration.h created  This file
        .                       cleaned up, documented and simplified.
